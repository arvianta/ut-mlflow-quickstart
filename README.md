# UT MLflow Quickstart Challenge

## About Dataset

### Problem Statement
You are working as a data scientist in a global finance company. Over the years, the company has collected basic bank details and gathered a substantial amount of credit-related information. The management aims to build an intelligent system that can classify customers into credit score brackets to minimize manual efforts.

### Task
Using a personâ€™s credit-related information, build a machine learning model that can classify their credit score.
