## UT MLflow Quickstart Challenge

Welcome to the **UT MLflow Quickstart Challenge**! This challenge is designed to help participants implement MLflow in a machine learning project and enhance their skills by building an intelligent system that classifies people into credit score brackets.

### Dataset Brief

**About the Dataset:**
You are a data scientist at a global finance company. Over the years, this company has amassed a large dataset containing basic bank details and extensive credit-related information about its clients. To streamline internal processes and reduce manual workload, the management wants to build a predictive model that can classify clients into credit score categories. The goal is to use the data available to create an accurate classification model that can predict a person's credit score bracket.

**Problem Statement:**
Given a person’s credit-related data, your task is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify their credit score.

### Dataset Columns Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

- **Customer_ID**: Unique identifier for each entry.
- **Month**: Specifies the month of the year.
- **Name**: The full name of the person.
- **Age**: The age of the person.
- **SSN**: Social Security Number, a unique identification number for each person.
- **Occupation**: The occupation or job title of the person.
- **Annual_Income**: The total yearly income of the person.
- **Monthly_Inhand_Salary**: The person’s monthly base salary.
- **Num_Bank_Accounts**: The number of bank accounts owned by the person.
- **Num_Credit_Card**: The number of credit cards held by the person.
- **Interest_Rate**: The interest rate on the credit card held by the person.
- **Num_of_Loan**: The total number of loans taken by the person.
- **Type_of_Loan**: The types of loans taken (e.g., personal, home, auto).
- **Delay_from_due_date**: The average days delayed from the due payment date.
- **Num_of_Delayed_Payment**: The average number of delayed payments by the person.
- **Changed_Credit_Limit**: The percentage change in the person's credit limit.
- **Num_Credit_Inquiries**: The number of credit inquiries made by the person.
- **Credit_Mix**: Classification of the person's mix of credits.
- **Outstanding_Debt**: The remaining debt amount owed by the person (in USD).
- **Credit_Utilization_Ratio**: The person's credit card utilization ratio.
- **Credit_History_Age**: The length of the person's credit history.
- **Payment_of_Min_Amount**: Indicator of whether only the minimum amount was paid by the person.
- **Total_EMI_per_month**: Monthly EMI (equated monthly installment) payments in USD.
- **Amount_invested_monthly**: The monthly amount invested by the person (in USD).
- **Payment_Behaviour**: The person's payment behavior (e.g., prompt or delayed).
- **Monthly_Balance**: The ending monthly balance amount (in USD).

### Challenge Objective

The primary goal of this challenge is to use MLflow to track and manage each step of the model development lifecycle. This involves implementing MLflow to log parameters, metrics, and models for the entire machine learning workflow, from data preparation and training to evaluation. The winner of the challenge will be determined by the accuracy of the final model, with the highest accuracy receiving top honors.

**Best of luck, and may the best model win!**
